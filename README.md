# just-dsa-csharp
A basic library with common data structures and algorithms. Production ready but also meant to be easy enough to use for learning.

# Why?
Well, I figured as I embarked on journey to master data structures and algorithms, it would probably be useful to not only write implementations, but also to use the data structures and the algorithms in my day to day code, hence the library.

Hopefully the information in this library is useful to others too.
